## Project Description

Smart Contract-Based Exams is a blockchain-based solution designed to revolutionize the exam process. By leveraging Ethereum's smart contract technology, this project automates exam grading and certification, ensuring a transparent, secure, and immutable examination process. This contract allows educational institutions to create and manage exams, while students can submit their answers, receive automated grades, and get certified based on their performance. The use of smart contracts guarantees fairness and reduces administrative overhead.

## Key Features

- **Exam Creation**: Enables educators to create exams with a list of questions and their correct answers.
- **Automated Grading**: Automatically grades student submissions by comparing their answers to the correct ones.
- **Certification**: Issues a certificate to students who meet or exceed the pass score threshold.
- **Pass Score Management**: Allows the pass score threshold to be updated by the contract owner as needed.
- **Submission Tracking**: Provides a transparent record of student submissions and their grading outcomes.

## Project Vision

Our vision for the Smart Contract-Based Exams project is to enhance the educational assessment process through the use of blockchain technology. We aim to create a system where exams are not only more secure and transparent but also more efficient. By automating grading and certification, we seek to reduce administrative burdens on educational institutions and provide students with a reliable and tamper-proof record of their achievements. Ultimately, we envision this technology being adopted widely to ensure fairness and integrity in educational assessments worldwide.
